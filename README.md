### Project Title: Advanced Machine Learning Course Project

This project was completed as part of an advanced machine learning course and involved running classic ML algorithms to solve two distinct problems: classification and regression. The objective was to identify the best-fitting models for each problem through a comprehensive process that included data preparation, feature selection, and model evaluation.

#### Key Steps and Methods:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Collected and cleaned datasets to ensure quality and reliability.
   - Handled missing values and outliers to improve data integrity.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Applied various feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features for each problem.
   - Compared different approaches to determine the optimal feature set that enhances model performance.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Implemented multiple classic ML algorithms for both classification and regression tasks.
   - Used synthetic data to augment training datasets, boosting model performance.
   - Conducted rigorous model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) values.

#### Achievements:

- **Classification Problem:**
  - Achieved the highest accuracy and F1 scores in the class, indicating superior model performance in correctly predicting class labels.

- **Regression Problem:**
  - Attained the best MSE and R² values, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in predicting continuous outcomes with high precision.

This project was recognized for its exceptional performance, with the models evaluated as the best in class for both the classification and regression problems. The success of this project underscores the importance of meticulous data preparation and effective feature selection in developing high-performing machine learning models.
