# 🔬 Final ML Course Project: Classification & Regression Mastery

## 📊 Advanced Machine Learning — Final Project👨‍💼 Author: Maor Nave📂 Course: Advanced ML (Fall 2025)📈 Focus: Data prep, feature selection, model evaluation

# 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of an advanced machine learning course and focused on developing and evaluating classic ML algorithms for two core tasks:

Classification — Predicting discrete class labels

Regression — Estimating continuous numeric values

Through rigorous data preparation, strategic feature selection, and thorough evaluation, the models trained achieved the best performance scores in class, showcasing exceptional predictive power.

# 📄 Key Workflow & Techniques

## 1. 📁 Data Preparation

Cleaned raw datasets and addressed missing values

Detected and handled outliers

Ensured data integrity for reliable model training

## 2. 🔍 Feature Selection

Evaluated multiple feature selection techniques

Identified optimal feature subsets tailored to each problem type

Boosted model interpretability and efficiency

## 3. 🔧 Model Training & Evaluation

Implemented a variety of classic ML models for both tasks

Augmented datasets using synthetic data techniques

## Evaluated models using:

Accuracy and F1 Score for classification

Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² for regression

# 🏆 Results & Achievements

🔢 Classification

✅ Highest accuracy and F1 score in the class

Model achieved superior performance in classifying target labels correctly

📈 Regression

✅ Best MSE and R² values in the class

Model demonstrated high precision in predicting continuous variables

This project was officially recognized for delivering top-tier model performance in both the classification and regression domains (evaluated 1st in class) . It highlights the crucial role of clean data and intelligent feature engineering in building effective ML systems.
